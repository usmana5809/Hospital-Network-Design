## Abstract
In response to the evolving healthcare landscape, this project aims to design and implement a robust network infrastructure for Melbourne Health Services using Cisco Packet Tracer. The focus is on enhancing security, operational efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

---

## Introduction
Melbourne Health Services operates across multiple locations, necessitating a secure and efficient network infrastructure. The project proposes the design and implementation of a hierarchical network model using Cisco Packet Tracer to meet these needs.

---

## Problem Statement
Current reliance on third-party IT services poses challenges related to cost efficiency and data security. Internalizing network infrastructure control is crucial for ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

---

## Project Goal
To establish a resilient and cost-effective network infrastructure for Melbourne Health Services through the deployment of a hierarchical network model using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## Proposed Methodology
### Hierarchical Network Design:
- Utilize Core Routers, Multilayer Switches, and Access Switches.
- Implement redundancy strategies for enhanced reliability.

### VLANs and Subnetting:
- Allocate VLANs and subnets for departmental segregation.
- Apply VLAN configurations for secure traffic management.

### Security Measures:
- Configure Access Control Lists (ACLs) for user access control.
- Implement Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions for secure communication.
- Enforce port-security measures to restrict unauthorized access.

### Routing Protocol (OSPF):
- Deploy OSPF for dynamic routing and efficient data transmission.

### DHCP Configuration:
- Set up DHCP servers for IP address management.
- Allocate static IPs for stability within the network.

### Monitoring and Testing:
- Integrate network monitoring tools for performance optimization.
- Conduct comprehensive testing to validate network functionality.
